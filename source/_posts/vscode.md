##  vscode build
***不需要配置！！！***   
need to learn  **cmakelists.txt**     

there had cmakelists.txt,then   

open terminal ：

```bash
mkdir build 
cd .\build\
cmake ..
make
```
too easy.    


## configure     
>launch.json and task.json    

there genetate default launch.json and task.json        
*in launch.json*   
```
"progrom": "here is a executable file" //generated by cmake ,designated by cmakelists.txt

```
*in task.json*    
Just like a shell to build     


## some common operations      
1.shift between en and zh_ch      
	shift + ctrl +p       
	configure display language           
2.choose theme
